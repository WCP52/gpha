Owner's Manual.

To build the manual from the LaTeX source, a PDF-supporting LaTeX installation
is required (recommended: TeX Live). The manual source includes data from the
PCB directory, which is generated by the Makefile there. Diagrams in EPS format
are drawn by XCircuit and can be edited directly.
