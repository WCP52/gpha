Firwmare for WCP52 Gain/Phase Analyzer.

To compile, run ``make`` inside the ``wcp52fw`` directory. The only build
dependency is ``arm-none-eabi-gcc``. The code requires a C99-capable compiler.

The ``scpi-parser`` subdirectory is a subtree containing `Jan Breuer's SCPI
parser library <https://github.com/j123b567/scpi-parser>`_.
